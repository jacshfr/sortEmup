Sorting via Heapsort


Original sorting was Heapsort;

Put in my own code that I worked from Wiki sorting article.  Works when there is like 5 items, but you get above that and it breaks.

Just for the assignment I found a selection sort and rewrote that in so I could have something to show.

I will keep working to get my own code functioning.
